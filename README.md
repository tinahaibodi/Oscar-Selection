# Oscar Selection
OscarSelection: A server that gives you the imbd rating and voting data of a movie via terminal to increase optimization while trying to select a film to watch. 

Inspiration: While being on reading week, I realized that I had spent 20 minutes selecting from the list of potential academy award winners and decided that I should optimize the time of my selection with data through a server based on voting/rating data provided by IMDB.


## the following are instructions about installation:

## install

$ npm install --global imdb-rating

## usage

$ imdb-rating -t [name of movie/film]
e.g.

$ imdb-rating -t get out

Rating: 9.5 / 758,602 votes [Get Out]
