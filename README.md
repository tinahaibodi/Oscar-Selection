# oscar-selection
oscarseason: a server that gives you the imbd rating of a movie via terminal if you're trying to select a movie to watch

while being on reading week, i realized that i had spent 20 minutes selecting from the list of potential academy award winners and decided that i should optimize the time of my selection with data through a server based on voting/rating data provided by imdb

steps to install include: 

## install

$ npm install --global imdb-rating

## usage

$ imdb-rating -t [name of movie/film]
e.g.

$ imdb-rating -t get out

Rating: 9.5 / 758,602 votes [Get Out]
